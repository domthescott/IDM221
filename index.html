  <h2>Dom Scott</h2> 
<p>Dom Scott is a photographer from New Jersey who is now based in Philadelphia. He has been taking photos for as long as he remembers,
  and was inspired by his father who also dabbles in the art. Dom takes a special interest in nature photography. From forests to 
  mountains, Dom loves venturing out into the wild and coming home with a beautiful shot to show for the journey. At the core of
  his artistic vision, Dom cares about capturing the beauty in seemingly innocuous subjects. Whether it be a swaying flower amidst a field, an abandoned
  structure left forgotten in the middle of the woods, or a single leaf far from its tree, Dom believes that there is magic to be found
  in every crevice of life.
