This photo uses a heavy filter. This filter imbues the shadows with dark shades of violet and blue, and brings out the warm yellow and orange tones of the light. This creates a complementary relationship between the light and shadows. This composition highlights how light travels and reflects off of surfaces. The orange lamps cast a blazing reflection on the metal edge of the countertop. The white light of the background illuminates the countertop’s surface. There are several gradients present in the composition, the orange reflection on the metal surface fades into dark blue and the splotches of ceiling lights do the same. The photo has a shallow depth of field. A portion of the countertop is in focus, but the majority of the photo is blurry and vague. Undefined silhouettes of figures can be seen in the background.

This composition also uses lines and geometry to create visual structure. The edge of the countertop creates a central leading line. Although the viewer’s eye is initially drawn to the portion of the photo that is in focus, the leading line draws the viewer’s attention deeper into space. In addition to the central leading line, the stands of each of the lamps create diagonal lines that move in a different direction. The square tiles of the countertop also reinforce the theme of diagonal lines. There is significant contrast between the defined edges of these tiles and the undefined edges of the background. Overall, the composition is very dynamic, due to the many diagonal lines. This photo was taken with an Iphone at the Cherry Hill Mall in New Jersey.
