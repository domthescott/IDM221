   <p>This photo features contrast in terms of saturation. The foreground and middleground are very desaturated, containing shades of dull brown. This is because the photo was taken during the fall. The plant life was mostly dead and dried out, lacking any lush green vibrancy. In contrast, the sky contains blue shades with medium saturation. The composition is essentially split into halves which differ in terms of level of saturation. The halves also differ in terms of texture. While the foreground and middle ground feature a rough texture of underbrush, rocks, and dirt, the sky in the background lacks texture as it is a simple gradient of different shades of blue. Because there is a hill in the middle ground, the divide between the ground and the sky is made with an interesting curved line.

         This composition uses the rule of thirds. The flower which is in focus is offset from the center of the photo. This creates visual interest. It also helps to balance the photo. The sun in the top left corner has weight, so placing the flower closer to the right side helps to balance it out. Lighting also plays an interesting role in this composition. Certain areas of the flower nearest to the camera are illuminated, while others are dark. This is due to the direction from which light is traveling. Additionally, the sky varies in shades of blue because of this lighting, becoming darker as the viewer looks farther to the right. This photo was taken on an Iphone at the Blueberry Hill Trail in Cherry Hill New Jersey.
